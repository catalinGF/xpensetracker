Expense Tracker - expense tracking

The idea starts from the excels that have been keeping track of expenses for several years.

The application contains a PostgresSQL relational database with 3  tables:

- Users
- Categories
- Expenses

For a tiny GUI I have used Thymeleaf - a template engine for Java. (documentation, examples, etc.)
